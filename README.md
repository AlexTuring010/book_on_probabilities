# Probabilities Quick Presentation for University Class

This repository stores a PDF book I made, named "*Whats the probability to pass the exams?*", a resource created to support our university’s students in understanding and preparing for probability concepts and exams. This project is a comprehensive yet accessible presentation on probability theory, based on lecture notes and in-class examples, with additional examples and explanations to support self-study.

## 📘 About the Book

This PDF presentation is written in Greek and was developed to be visually engaging, with many diagrams and illustrations to make complex topics easier to understand. While it’s a work in progress, it already covers a wide range of topics in probability theory and contains most of the examples we discussed during in-person lectures, along with some new examples I created. 

### Topics Covered
- **Introduction to Probability theory**
- **Quick revision on Discrete Mathematics (needs further refinement)**
- **Discrete and Continuous Random Variables (would like to write more in the future)**
  
*Note: Additional theory and a full set of exercise problems are planned for future versions.*

## 📈 Future Goals

While this presentation already has a substantial amount of content, I aim to:
- Add more theoretical explanations, and expand the theory further.
- Create a comprehensive set of exercise problems at the end to help students prepare for exams.
- Continuously improve explanations to make the material more accessible and complete.

## 🙋‍♂️ My Learning Experience

This project was a significant learning experience for me, not only in terms of deepening my understanding of probability but also in developing my skills in organizing a large project, using visuals to convey complex ideas, and refining my ability to teach. I’m aware that some sections may need further clarity, but overall, I’m proud of the effort and care I put into this presentation. Many students have found it helpful as a quick refresher before exams, and I hope it continues to serve as a valuable resource.

## 📌 Acknowledgments and Purpose

This book reflects my commitment to our university community, and I hope it shows my knowledge of probability and my dedication to creating educational resources that make learning more approachable. I also want to acknowledge that I could not have completed this project without the guidance from our professors and the discussions in class.
